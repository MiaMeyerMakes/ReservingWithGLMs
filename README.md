# Reserving with GLMs

The R script it based on the [article](https://institute-and-faculty-of-actuaries.github.io/mlr-blog/post/foundations/r-glms/#loss-reserve) by Machine Learning in Reserving Working Party, written by Grainne McGuire and published on 26th April 2021.

However, most of the code is in the python script, based on the article [Reserving with GLMs in Python](https://institute-and-faculty-of-actuaries.github.io/mlr-blog/post/foundations/python-glms/index.html#data)

If the concepts seem new, make sure to go look at their [introductory post](https://institute-and-faculty-of-actuaries.github.io/mlr-blog/post/foundations/intro-to-foundations-blog/) on GLM foundations.
